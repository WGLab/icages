# iCAGES Documentation

iCAGES is an efficient software tool to prioritizes personalized cancer driver mutations, genes and drugs. Given input in ANNOVAR input format, VCF format or BED format, iCAGES can generate a list of 

- iCAGES mutation scores for all point coding variants, non-coding variants and structural variations, which measure genomic cancer driving potential of these variants.

- iCAGES gene scores for all mutated genes, which measure personal cancer driving potential of these genes.

- iCAGES drug scores for all potential drugs targeting any gene mutated in this particular patient.

Please click the menu items to navigate through this website. The web interface of iCAGES may be previously accessed [here](http://icages.wglab.edu) (the server was shut down by the previous university, so if you want to run the web server, please download it and run yourself from [here](https://github.com/WGLab/icages-server). If you have questions, comments and bug reports, please post them in the Disqus comment form in this website (or email me <coco90417@gmail.com> or my mentor Dr. Kai Wang <kaichop@gmail.com> directly). Thank you very much for your help and support!
